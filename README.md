## DESCRIPTION

This Cordova / PhoneGap plugin enables the integration of Unity Ads video ads into your cordova mobile games or apps in a way that both increases player engagement and puts more money in your pocket over the gamerâ€™s lifetime. Unity Ads offers the highest Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) of any global rewarded video ad network.


## PLUGIN BACKGROUND

A couple of years ago, and after a great mistake, I got banned from Google AdsMob network. After appels to the mercy of Google, explaining what happens... I remain banned for life.  This put me on a very bad situation those days, with a very short list of good monetizing alternatives.  This ends the day I learn about UnityAds

After the end of the UnityAds 1.x Api era, I have to move forward and Implement UnityAds 2.x on my projects. Implement it on the Unity Game Engine was a breeze, But then I didn't found any solutions to implement version 2.x on my html5, cordova, construct 2 or 3 projects.  That my friends, makes this cordova plugin a reality. Oh well, it was basically, necessity!
